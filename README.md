[fix]
- added Jotho dependency to retrieving process

[improvement] Lever Quest
- removed that 50 long if statment queue, which in all honesty I couldn't read at all. Instead:
- puzzle solver added. Can work even if they decide to rearrange doors or levers. Just modify 
  input tables at that time.
```
- Branch: GoldenRod Lever Puzzle
- Features:
	- automated Bellspout catching (instead oddish) > less leveling, on the way,... = more efficient
    - puzzle solver
    
Hi everyone,

**[introduction]**

this is a questing fork, with the intention to improve, expedite and update the master version to new hights.
So see this as a beta version of the next Questing update. The original project owner is still wiwi and as such,
all released versions will be found in his project: https://github.com/WiWi33/Questing.lua.

As it didn't get any attention lately, Questing contains open problems that prevent it from functioning - I'll
try to make it work again as fast as possible.

My current priority list:
1. mandatory fixes
2. some appointed features

For the time being I don't intend add:

3. new functionallity
4. new content

**[pointers]**
- _[branches]_ As I am developing multiple features at times, multiple branches will exist. Feel free to
debug test any of them. And give me feedback. They can be found, when clicking the *branch button* top left
over the current project.
- _[issues]_ When encountering one use githubs issue system:
    - Title Format: I would prefer: "banchName | shortIssueDescription". This is due to the fact, that I couldn't find
    any options for branch correlating related issue tagging.
    - Quest: pls provide running quest - this looks like `[00:11:05] Starting new quest: Sould Badge: Fuchsia City`
    - Logs: add any form of log, you think could help narrowing down the error source. E.g.: Debug or normal textbox
    prints. Post them if unsure.
    - Detail: Provide as detailed as possible/willing. Details help a lot, when debugging.

_Side Note_: the more information (people using minus people that actually provide some) I/we get, the better it is for
identifying the error. Help me to help us all :)

Nice botting everyone ;)
